#AI Scheduler

This package takes care of choosing what actions to take based on an `actions` definition list.
The definition files are located under `src/Definitions`.

This package also contains the main launch files that start all system nodes.

For instance, in order to launch the main program with all system nodes,
run `roslaunch robot_ai_scheduler main.launch` after sourcing the workspace.
